description: |
   The ADP1050, ADP1051, and ADP1055 are used to monitor system voltages, 
   currents, power and temperatures.
   
   Through the PMBus interface, the ADP1050 targets isolated power supplies
   and has four individual monitors for input/output voltage, input current
   and temperature.

   Through the PMBus interface, the ADP1051 targets isolated power supplies
   and has six individual monitors for input/output voltage, input/output 
   current and temperature.
